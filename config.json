    "policies":"In order to book, we do require a credit card on file to hold your time slot. This allows for touch free check out at the front desk, and protects our stylists time. See cancellation policy below. We do not offer refunds for services. However, re-dos are offered and assessed case by case. If a mistake is made on our end, a re-do will be offered free of charge. A re-do only encompasses the service being re done. If you would like to add on a finishing service that will be an additional charge. To get a re-do appointment, please contact the front desk (not your stylist) no less than 7 days after your initial appointment. We will be happy to make sure you are perfectly satisfied with your hair! All sales are final for all hair products. We do not offer refunds for other goods and accessories, but within one week of purchase we offer an in store exchange. Cancellation Policy If you need to reschedule, please do so before the 48 hour window of your appointment. We reserve the right to charge 25% of services booked if cancelled within 48 hours and 50% if within 24 hours. If your appointment is no-showed we reserve the right to charge 100% of the booked services. Our 48 hour cancellation policy must be strictly enforced to protect our stylists time. If you are running late, please call the salon. After 15 minutes, we may accept or decline your appointment and the stylist may choose to alter services to accommodate the time available."
